Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies of repositories directly on github.
    Clones are copies of repositories on one's own computer.

    Forks are used to copy repositories directly on github, and clone on PCs. Branches are used when you want to create a new version of your program, or to work on a new feature.
